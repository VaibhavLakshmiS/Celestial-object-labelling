## Celestial Body Classifier: DS3 Datathon Project

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Celestial Body Classifier, developed as part of the DS3 Datathon.
This project represents our team's exploration into the vast universe, aiming to classify celestial bodies using data science techniques.

## Project Description
The Celestial Body Classifier is a machine learning model designed to accurately identify types of celestial objects (such as galaxies, stars, and quasars) based on various observational data. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we implemented a robust approach combining data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced neural network models.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Rigorous cleaning and standardization of SDSS data to ensure optimal input quality for our models.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Deep dive into the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights about the celestial objects, facilitating a more informed modeling approach.
- Machine Learning Model: Deployment of a sophisticated neural network architecture, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to classify celestial bodies. Our model leverages techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and advanced optimization strategies to enhance performance and accuracy.
-Innovative Techniques: Application of class weight balancing to address dataset imbalances, learning rate scheduling for improved training dynamics, and implementation of callbacks like early stopping and model checkpointing to prevent overfitting and ensure the model captures the most predictive features of the data.
- Cross-Validation Approach: Utilization of Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to rigorously evaluate the model's performance, ensuring its reliability and robustness.
## Results
Our Celestial Body Classifier has demonstrated high accuracy in classifying celestial objects, showcasing the potential of machine learning in astronomical applications. The detailed results and performance metrics are documented in our project reports and jupyter notebooks.
